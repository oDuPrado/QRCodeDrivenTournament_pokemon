# **Tournament Manager**

Tournament Manager is a live tournament management system designed to facilitate reporting and tracking results in real-time. Using Flask for the backend and a dynamic frontend, it integrates QR codes for seamless table identification and offers a responsive design suitable for any device.

---

## **Features**

1 -Configure the directory containing the tournament's .tdf files.<br>

2- Run <code>main_1</code> locally to monitor changes, generate QR codes for the tables, and create a PDF with players' PINs.<br>

3 - <code>main_2</code> runs on the online server, receiving updates and displaying the data.<br>

4- Provide players with their PIN and ID (printed in the generated PDF) so they can report results on their respective <code>mesa.html</code> pages.<br>

5-With each vote, the system updates the status on <code>report.html</code>, showing finalized tables, pending votes, or divergences, all in real-time (polling every 5 seconds).
